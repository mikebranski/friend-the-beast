If you run into any issues or have feedback about this content, [let us know!](https://github.com/mikebranski/friend-the-beast/issues)\r\n\r\n### Vitals\r\nHost: `65.26.247.183`  \r\nPort: `25565` (Minecraft default, no need to specify)\r\nMinecraft Version: 1.7.10  \r\nModpack: Direwolf20 v1.0.3\r\n\r\n_Be sure to check out the installation below, as we have added some additional mods - namely ReactorCraft and RotaryCraft (zomg physics)!_\r\n\r\n### Installing Additional Mods\r\n\r\nInstallation of the additional mods is easy, requiring one download and a config tweak.\r\n\r\n1. Download a zip of the mods: <https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bxc6Fv7mZPG8LTA3SnJUZHFKNzQ/view> (thanks James!)\r\n2. Extract the contents to the `direwolf20_17\\minecraft\\mods` where you installed FTB **-OR-** from the launcher you can [edit the modpack](http://ftbwiki.org/Tutorial:Installing_additional_mods) and add mods and it will move the files there.\r\n3. Once this is done, start the game (this will create the configs, etc). **Note:** it will crash this time.\r\n4. Now, open the `ReactorCraft.cfg` file located in the `direwolf20_17\\minecraft\\config\\Reika` directory.\r\n5. Locate the line `I:\"Radiation Effect ID\"=31` at the end of the file and change the ID from 31 to 82.\r\n6. Save and close the config file.\r\n\r\nThat's it! Launch the game again and you're all set. See you topside.\r\n\r\n### Etiquette\r\n\r\ntl;dr: This is a friendly server, so keep trolling to a minimum and have fun. Don't be a dick, m'kay?\r\n\r\n### Cast\r\n\r\narswrath - Keith  \r\nFakuma - James  \r\ngoforlava - Mike  \r\nkolpage - Tony","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
