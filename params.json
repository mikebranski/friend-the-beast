{"name":"Friend the Beast","tagline":"A gaming resource friends","body":"## Minecraft (Feed the Beast)\r\n\r\nOur Feed the Beast Minecraft server is being generously hosted by James - thank you! If you run into any issues or have feedback about this content, [let us know!](https://github.com/mikebranski/friend-the-beast/issues)\r\n\r\n### Vitals\r\nHost: `friendthebeast-mc.belaymylast.org`  \r\nDirect IP: `65.26.247.183`  \r\nPort: `25565` (Minecraft default, no need to specify)  \r\nMinecraft Version: 1.7.10  \r\nModpack: Direwolf20 v1.0.3\r\n\r\nConnecting via the friendly host name is preferred as you don't have to update anything and lose your waypoints when the IP changes. However, the direct IP is always provided in case you have trouble with the friendly URL.\r\n\r\n_Be sure to check out the installation section below, as we have added some additional mods - namely ReactorCraft and RotaryCraft (zomg physics)!_\r\n\r\n### Installing Additional Mods\r\n\r\nInstallation of the additional mods is easy, requiring one download and a config tweak.\r\n\r\n1. Download a zip of the mods: <https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bxc6Fv7mZPG8LTA3SnJUZHFKNzQ/view> (thanks James!)\r\n2. Extract the contents to the `direwolf20_17\\minecraft\\mods` where you installed FTB **-OR-** from the launcher you can [edit the modpack](http://ftbwiki.org/Tutorial:Installing_additional_mods) and add mods and it will move the files there.\r\n3. Once this is done, start the game (this will create the configs, etc). **Note:** it will crash this time.\r\n4. Now, open the `ReactorCraft.cfg` file located in the `direwolf20_17\\minecraft\\config\\Reika` directory.\r\n5. Locate the line `I:\"Radiation Effect ID\"=31` at the end of the file and change the ID from 31 to 82.\r\n6. Save and close the config file.\r\n\r\nThat's it! Launch the game again and you're all set. See you topside.\r\n\r\n### Etiquette\r\n\r\ntl;dr: This is a friendly server, so keep trolling to a minimum and have fun. Don't be a dick, m'kay?\r\n\r\n### FAQ\r\n\r\n#### Q. Halp! My waypoints disappeared!\r\nA. Rei Minimap stores all of your waypoints locally and they are based on the server host. So, if the host/IP address changes your waypoints will disappear. Fortunately, you can [rename the .points files](http://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/101958/where-does-reis-minimap-store-your-waypoints) and get them all back!\r\n\r\n### Cast\r\n\r\narswrath - Keith  \r\nFakuma - James  \r\ngoforlava - Mike  \r\nkolpage - Tony","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
